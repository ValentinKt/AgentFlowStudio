Create a workflow called “Customer Support Triage → Dev Plan”.

Goal:
When a customer submits a support request, automatically triage it, extract key details, decide priority, and produce a clean output for the team.

Trigger:
Webhook trigger called “Support Request Received”.

Inputs (ask the user for these if not provided):
- customer_name (text)
- customer_email (text)
- product_area (select: Billing, Auth, Dashboard, API, Mobile, Other)
- issue_summary (text)
- steps_to_reproduce (text)
- severity (select: Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- screenshots_or_links (text, optional)
- desired_output_channel (select: database, slack)

Actions:
- Consolidate the inputs into a structured incident report (include title, impact, reproduction, suspected area).
- Generate a recommended resolution plan with 5–10 concrete steps and owners (dev / QA / support).
- Draft a reply to the customer (friendly, clear, and brief).

Conditions:
- “Is this Critical?” → true if severity is Critical or High AND steps_to_reproduce are provided.
  - True path: add an action “Escalation Plan” (paging instructions + immediate mitigation steps).
  - False path: continue normal flow.
- “Needs Clarification?” → true if issue_summary is vague OR steps_to_reproduce are missing.
  - True path: create an action “Clarifying Questions” (5 questions to ask the customer).
  - False path: continue.

Outputs:
- Final output must include:
  - triage_summary
  - priority (P0–P3)
  - dev_plan
  - customer_reply
  - next_steps
- If desired_output_channel is slack, format as a Slack-ready message; otherwise save to database.
